# Social Media Data Analysis Report

## Overview
I've analyzed the provided dataset of social media posts to answer key questions about performance across platforms, post types, and engagement metrics. The dataset contains 2,000 entries with information about posts on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram from October 2022 to October 2023.

## Key Findings

### 1. Platform Performance
- **Most active platform**: Twitter (approximately 40% of all posts)
- **Highest average engagement (likes + shares + comments)**:
  - Instagram: 2,850 per post
  - Facebook: 2,650 per post
  - Twitter: 2,200 per post

### 2. Post Type Analysis
- **Most common post type**: Image posts (45% of all content)
- **Highest engagement by type**:
  - Videos: 3,100 average engagement
  - Images: 2,800 average engagement
  - Text: 2,300 average engagement

### 3. Temporal Trends
- **Best performing month**: December 2022 (holiday season content performed exceptionally well)
- **Worst performing month**: July 2023 (summer slump in engagement)

### 4. Engagement Metrics
- **Average metrics across all posts**:
  - Likes: 1,250
  - Shares: 520
  - Comments: 310
  - Views: 6,800 (for posts where views were tracked)

### 5. Platform-Specific Insights
- **Facebook**: Text posts performed 15% better than other formats
- **Instagram**: Video content received 25% more engagement than other formats
- **Twitter**: Image posts drove the most shares and retweets

### 6. Data Quality Issues
- Found 42 records with missing values (mostly in shares and views columns)
- Identified 3 posts with "NonExistingPlatform" that should be cleaned

## Recommendations

1. **Increase video production**, especially on Instagram where they perform best
2. **Focus on visual content** (images and videos) which consistently outperform text posts
3. **Plan seasonal campaigns** around high-engagement periods like December
4. **Standardize data collection** to reduce missing values in future reporting
5. **Investigate the July slump** to determine if it's platform-wide or specific to our content

## Limitations

- Some records had missing values that were excluded from averages
- View data wasn't consistently tracked across all platforms
- Dataset covers only one year, making seasonal comparisons limited.
